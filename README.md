# WebGL2 Tutorial

Home page: https://liruiernest.github.io/WebGL2-tutorial/

This repository contains a sequence of WebGL-2 examples.

## Updates

The original examples were created by Prof. [Han-Wei Shen](https://han-wei-shen.github.io/) in 2017. In 2023, Rui Li, the teaching assistant for this course during AU22 and SP23, updated these codes to the WebGL 2.0 version and added more examples.

* Updated the WebGL version to [2.0](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/).
* Upgraded the GLSL language to the ES 3.0 version.
* Revised JavaScript code and structure to comply with [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) standards.
* Updated the matrix computation library to [glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net/docs/) 2.8, offering users more comprehensive documentation.
* Replaced shader-setup.js with the shader-utils class for better support of multiple shader applications.
* Introduced a utils class to assist users in better synchronously loading (preloading) various assets required by the program, such as texture maps and models.
* Fixed some bugs present in the previous version.
* Added some new example codes, such as Phong shading.
